This is a Flutter project called WidgetsPractice. It demonstrates how to create and use both Stateless and Stateful Widgets, 
and how to create a widget tree at least 3 levels deep. It also demonstrates how to style widgets and test the app.
To Run the Project
1. Install Flutter and Dart.
2.Create a new file named greeting_widget.dart inside the lib folder. This widget will display a greeting message passed as a parameter.
3.In main.dart file, use the GreetingWidget with different messages
4.Create a new file named counter_widget.dart. This widget will display a counter that increments when a button is pressed.
5.In main.dart, add the CounterWidget below the GreetingWidget
6.You can customize the styles of your widgets by adjusting font sizes, colors, padding, etc., directly in their respective widget classes.
7.Run your app using flutter run in the terminal. Make sure everything works as expected on an emulator or a real device.

Youâ€™ve already created a simple widget tree with the GreetingWidget and CounterWidget:)
